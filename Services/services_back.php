                        Number of muscles and their tendons connected to the groin that can injured whether it is sudden or over time giving rise to groin pain. These include the rectus abdominis muscle, adductor muscle and iliopsoas muscle. ‘Hernias’ and stress around the pubic symphysis which connects your pubic bones also can cause groin pain. Usually the problem is a kicking sport but the groin can also be strained if performing an activity which causes an excessive stretch to any of the muscles or on strain on the pelvis itself. Often when groin pain is experienced more than one of the above is affected.
                        <br>
                        It is vital to have physiotherapy as soon as possible if a groin strain is suspected as if you continue to play sport hoping the pain will resolve itself your recovery is likely to take a long time. A physiotherapist can be organised to come to you and take a detailed history and perform a full physical assessment including specific tests. They will then be able to tell where your groin pain is coming from and what is contributing to causing the pain. They can then treat you effectively by taking you through a specific progressive exercise programme and use other treatments such as myofascial release, acupuncture and anti-inflammatory treatment on the affected area. The aim will be to return you to sport pain free as soon as possible. They will also be able to advise you on exercise you can doing during rehab to keep up your fitness.

                        A bursa is a fluid-filled sac situated between a bone and a tendon, serving to ensure a smooth gliding surface for mobility. Inflammation of these bursae can disrupt this smooth movement, leading to discomfort. The hip area contains several such bursae, with the trochanteric bursa, found around the greater trochanter (or hip head) and the gluteus muscle tendon, being the most prominent. This inflammation can result in a burning pain, which tends to worsen when lying on the affected side and during activities such as walking or climbing stairs. Morning discomfort is also common. Additionally, the ischial bursa, located in the ischium, can cause upper buttock pain, especially when sitting for extended periods or ascending inclines.
                        <br>
                        Physiotherapy can be beneficial by addressing any biomechanical issues related to your walking or movement patterns. It also involves strengthening and stretching the gluteal muscles, along with core stability exercises, which are often effective in managing this condition. To alleviate inflammation, corticosteroid injections may be administered before engaging in activities. If necessary, we can provide recommendations for top doctors who specialise in treating these conditions.

                        The major pelvic joints can experience excessive mobility or become stiff, leading to potential strain on nearby structures and resulting in pain in the groin or buttocks. This discomfort is often triggered when performing activities like turning in bed or engaging in weight-bearing exercises.

                        Physiotherapy can play a crucial role in identifying whether the pain is linked to sacroiliac joint issues through a comprehensive examination and specific tests.

                        When you move your hip, the ball at the top of the thigh bone moves within its socket, which is part of the pelvis. Surrounding this socket is a ring of cartilage called the labrum. Issues can arise deep within the hip joint, leading to potential friction between joint surfaces and the tearing of the labrum. Symptoms often manifest as pain in the groin, hip, and buttock areas. Activities that may exacerbate these symptoms include heavy labour, twisting movements, crouching, extended walks, and participation in sports. You might also experience clicking, snapping, or a sensation of instability. Accurate identification of the root cause of your symptoms requires further medical imaging.

                        There are 2 meniscus. These are half-moon shaped pieces of cartilage that sit between the tibia (shin bone) and femur (thigh bone) within the joint of the knee. The medial meniscus is the one on the inside of the knee joint. They help to lubricate the knee joint and provide shock absorption on impact. Sometimes if the knee is twisted then they can become inflamed or torn. There can be pain or clicking on certain activities ie. getting out of the car or rolling over in bed. If the tear is significant then there can be significant pain and swelling.

The bottom end runs over the lateral epicondyle (piece of bone) of the thigh bone. There is a small piece of adipose tissue (fat) which lies between this piece of bone and the iliotibial band and this contains nerve fibres and if becomes inflamed can cause pain. The pain tends to be sharp and burning and usually becomes worse as the activity (running) continues. Often running downhill is worse.

It is important for stability of the knee and can be torn or even ruptured if there is a direct hit to the lower leg while the knee is bent or if the knee is pushed backwards. The pain is most often felt at the back of the knee and not easy to pinpoint exactly where it is coming from. Swelling does not often happen if injured. Your physiotherapist will be able to perform tests to determine whether this ligament has been injured and the severity of the injury. If the tests show significant injury to the ligament or even possible rupture a medical review with a t knee consultant will be required. The consultant will investigate the problem and decide whether to operate to repair the ligament or treat with physiotherapy only.

Strains can affect these muscles to varying degrees, and all three can be susceptible to strains. The severity of a muscular strain can be classified into grades. Grade I strain involve only a small portion of the muscle fibres and result in localised discomfort. Grade II strains are characterised by pain, swelling, reduced strength, and potential limitations in movement due to a more extensive tear of muscle fibres. Grade III strains represent a complete tear of the muscle.

                        The femoral nerve, which runs down the front of the thigh, is derived from the nerve roots of the lumbar spine. Compression of this nerve can occur at various points along its path, including tight muscles it passes through or the point where it exits the lumbar spine. Additionally, direct damage to the nerve, such as from a pelvic fracture, or prolonged pressure on the nerve can lead to symptoms. These symptoms may include pain along the front of the leg, numbness or tingling in the thigh, a sense of weakness in the leg and knee, and a feeling that the leg might give way.

                        The body consists of various compartments, and the sciatic nerve and hamstring muscles reside in the compartment at the rear of the thigh. Compartment syndrome, characterised by increased pressure within this compartment leading to reduced blood supply to the muscles, can result in pain. During exercise, the muscles attempt to expand, but they are constrained in doing so. This condition is more likely to affect individuals with a history of hamstring injuries and endurance athletes. Common symptoms include a sensation of tightness in the limb and a persistent, dull pain. Weakness and muscle cramps at the back of the leg can also occur, both before and after exercise.

                        The calf muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius and soleus, play a significant role in activities like jumping and rising onto your toes. These muscles combine to form the Achilles tendon, which attaches to the back of the heel. Sometimes, this tendon can rupture or tear due to overexertion of the calf muscles or excessive backward flexing of the foot, which places stress on the tendon. Additionally, a deep cut to the back of the leg can result in Achilles tendon injury. Symptoms may include a sudden sensation of being kicked in the back of the leg and immediate pain. While you may still be able to bear weight on the affected leg, walking and rising onto your toes may be challenging. In such cases, your physiotherapist can conduct specific tests to diagnose the condition. If there is suspicion of an Achilles tendon injury, it’s crucial to consult with a foot and ankle specialist promptly, and we can recommend one for you. Delaying treatment may hinder the recovery process. The consultant will determine whether surgical or conservative treatment is appropriate, such as using a supportive, customised boot.
