                    Elderly care Physiotherapists have the knowledge to understand the difference between normal ageing and pathological conditions affecting capabilities. Dementia, falls, fractures and neurological conditions are the major cause of reduced mobility, muscle strength, function, confidence and abilities in elderly. Timely assessment by a qualified Physiotherapist can help in developing a rehabilitation plan with specific goals aimed towards improving the muscle- strength, movement and functional abilities of the older individuals.
                    <br>
                    Physio at home for elderly individuals is highly effective in improving the mobility, balance, and function. It is a well-documented fact that a person rehabilitates best in their home environment.
                    <br>
                    The Physiotherapist will do detailed assessment of strength, flexibility, balance, co-ordination, mobility, equipment, and aids used. Following assessment, personalised rehabilitation plan will be developed which will be monitored, reviewed, and modified as needed. We provide ‘hands on Physiotherapy’ and not just a piece of paper with instructions.
                    <br>
                    We offer a range of services specifically designed for the special needs of old and elderly citizens such as Improvement of Mobility, Pain Control, Preventing Falls, Post-Surgical Rehabilitation.

                    The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and nerves. When something causes a problem within the nervous system then this can lead to a neurological disorder, which can cause problems moving, swallowing, talking and even breathing. Sometimes it causes disturbances in mood, sensations and memory loss.
                    <br>
                    Individuals with neurological conditions might encounter difficulties in their daily lives due to the disruptions caused by these conditions. Simple tasks that many take for granted, such as walking, lifting objects, or maintaining balance, can become formidable obstacles.
                    <br>
                    After conducting the initial physiotherapy neurological assessment, the role of the therapist is to ascertain the patient’s specific needs and design a neurological rehabilitation programme.

                    Musculoskeletal (MSK) physiotherapy is a specialised branch of physical therapy dedicated to assessing and treating conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system. This intricate system encompasses muscles, bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons, crucial for mobility and stability. MSK physiotherapists employ a holistic approach, utilising tailored exercises, manual techniques, and modalities to alleviate pain, restore function, and enhance overall musculoskeletal health. Whether rehabilitating injuries or managing chronic conditions, these skilled practitioners play a pivotal role in optimising mobility and improving the quality of life for their patients.

                    We often place our musculoskeletal system under intense pressure, especially if we do a repetitive activity or take part in strenuous activity. Whilst for the most part this complex arrangement of bone, cartilage, muscle, ligaments, tendons and soft tissue can bend, stretch and flex to accommodate movement, musculoskeletal injuries can occur.
                    <br>
                    Injuries can vary in severity and musculoskeletal pain. It can be anything from a minor twinge to debilitating agony. In order to ascertain the extent of your injuries you will need a musculoskeletal assessment of your pain and/or injury. Then your physio will be able to use a number of skills that can include manual therapy, acupuncture, massage and design a rehabilitation programme to aid your recovery.
                    <br>
                    The aim of sport physiotherapy is to identify the sport injury and work with you to restore your body to full health and back to sport. To do this, the sport physiotherapist will devise a recovery plan that includes numerous musculoskeletal physical therapy tools, as above including sport injury massage, rehabilitation exercise, dietary plans and more. The treatment will be more sports specific.

                    Therapeutic/ Sports massage is a hands-on-treatment, which employs a variety of techniques to create changes in the soft tissues of the body such as skin fascia, muscles, tendons and ligaments. There is strong evidence that massage can help reduce the level of pain or stress and improve general wellbeing. The massage techniques are deeper form of soft tissue release aiming to decrease muscular pain, improve circulation, muscle tone, function and help to alleviate physical and psychological stresses in the body.
                    <br>
                    It reduces the joint swelling, risk of injury and speeds up the recovery in the injured muscle tissue. Massage and soft tissue mobilisation ease the “knots” which are formed due to muscle imbalance. In addition to above, massage also stimulates few other chemicals like melatonin (promoting sleep) and serotonin (chemical for happiness).
                    <br>
                    These chemicals stimulate healing process and ease the intensity of pain which helps physiotherapists to employ other manual techniques. We may also advice on stretching and strengthening exercises if appropriate to work in conjunction with treatment.

                    Cupping therapy is a therapeutic technique that utilizes a vacuum force created beneath a small vessel applied onto the skin's surface. This approach focuses on blood and autologous healing substances in a specific area, stimulating metabolic activity, improving immune function, and stabilizing blood biochemistry.
                    <br>
                    Cupping is typically categorized into 2 primary procedures, wet and dry cupping. In both techniques, containers made from various materials are used to create a vacuum over a specific area of the skin. However, suction is applied in a wet cupping procedure to draw small quantities of blood and extracellular fluid from the body, typically after creating minor incisions or superficial skin abrasions, often in significantly smaller amounts than conventional bloodletting practices.
                    <br>
                    Benefits of cupping therapy include, encourage whole-body comfort and relaxation, increase your pain threshold, reduce inflammation, enhance blood circulation, remove toxins from your body, stimulate your peripheral nervous system.

                    Clinical Pilates is traditional Pilates-type exercise combined with physiotherapy assessment and expertise to provide very suitable exercises for people recovering from injury or working around specific injuries or conditions. It is generally delivered one-to-one or in small groups. Clinical Pilates has proved so effective at rehabilitation especially for spinal problems.

                    The key components of Pilates are quite subtle and it is very easy to use the wrong muscles and not do it properly. Joining a group in a class setting can be confusing if you have never tried Pilates before and can even aggravate your symptoms or condition. If you have a specific injury or condition some Pilates exercises may not be suitable for you. A one-to-one session is tailored for you and your specific level and requirements. Many of our clients go on to join group classes or work on their own home-programme once they are familiar with the Pilates concept and have achieved a safe level of competency.
